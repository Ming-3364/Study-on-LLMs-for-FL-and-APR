If `classNames` is a field, you might need to copy the collection or array of class names explicitly.

            "ernie-3.5-128k": "Certainly! The issue with `clone.classNames();` is that it appears to be a method call that doesn't do anything useful in the context of cloning. Typically, `classNames()` might be a getter or a method that returns class names associated with an `Element`, but it doesn't modify the `clone` object in any way.\n\nAssuming you want to clone the class names as well, you should have a way to set the class names on the cloned object. Let's assume there is a method `setClassNames(List<String> classNames)` that you can use to set the class names. Here's how you might fix it:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic Element clone() {\n    Element clone = (Element) super.clone();\n    // Assuming getClassNames() returns a list of class names and setClassNames(List<String>) sets them\n    clone.setClassNames(this.getClassNames());\n    return clone;\n}\n```\n\nNote that this assumes the existence of `getClassNames()` and `setClassNames(List<String>)` methods in the `Element` class. If these methods have different signatures or if the class names are stored in a different way, you would need to adjust the code accordingly.\n\nIf `classNames()` is indeed just a getter and there's no setter, and if you cannot modify the `Element` class to add a setter, you might need to use a different approach to copy the class names, depending on how they are stored internally. However, the above example is a common pattern for cloning objects that have attributes that need to be deep-copied."
