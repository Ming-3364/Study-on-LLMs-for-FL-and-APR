Instead of returning `null` when the next newline cannot be found, we now check if `nextNewLineIndex` is `-1`. If it is, we return the substring from the current position to the end of the string (`js.substring(pos)`). This ensures that the entire remainder of the file is returned correctly when no more newlines are present after the current position.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_56-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/SourceFile.java:263: error: ';' expected\n    [javac]   public Region getRegion(int lineNumber) {\n    [javac]         ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_56-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/SourceFile.java:263: error: invalid method declaration; return type required\n    [javac]   public Region getRegion(int lineNumber) {\n    [javac]                 ^\n    [javac] 88 errors\n    [javac] 1 warning\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_56-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/build.xml:246: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\nTotal time: 15 seconds\nCannot compile sources! at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/d4j/d4j-compile line 82.\nCompilation failed in require at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/defects4j line 195.\n"
