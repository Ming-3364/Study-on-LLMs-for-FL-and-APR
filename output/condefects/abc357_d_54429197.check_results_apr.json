The issue on line [4] seems to be related to the usage of the `mexp` function. It appears that `mexp` might be intended to represent modular exponentiation, but it's not defined in the provided code. Additionally, there are undefined variables such as `sc`, `m`, and functions like `mexp` and `mul`. I'll assume some typical definitions for these based on common conventions:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ^\nMain.java:13: error: <identifier> expected\nCertainly!
