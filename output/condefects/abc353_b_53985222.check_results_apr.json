This causes the logic to incorrectly handle the case where `nums[idx]` is greater than `k`. To fix this, we need to ensure that `temp` is reset to `k` and then decremented by `nums[idx]` only if `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `k`. If `nums[idx]` is greater than `k`, we should increment the count and reset `temp` to `k` without decrementing it.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ^\nMain.java:3: error: illegal character: \\96\nThe bug in the code is in line 13, where the `temp` variable is decremented by `nums[idx]` after resetting `temp` to `k`.
