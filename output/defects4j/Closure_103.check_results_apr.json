The issue you're encountering seems to be a typecast problem. The `prototype.getOwnerFunction()` method likely returns a `FunctionType`, but if the type system is strictly typed or there are subclasses involved, it might need explicit handling. However, in your provided code, the cast to `FunctionPrototypeType` is already done correctly, so the issue might be related to ensuring that `getOwnerFunction()` indeed returns a non-null `FunctionType`.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_103-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/DisambiguateProperties.java:780: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] Certainly!
