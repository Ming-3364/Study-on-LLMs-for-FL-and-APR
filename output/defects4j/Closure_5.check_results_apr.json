To address this, we should ensure that we have a mechanism to track all valid properties, including those potentially inherited from `Object.prototype`. However, since JavaScript's prototype chain can be dynamic and complex, a practical approach is to consider all properties mentioned in the code as valid if they are used in assignment contexts that suggest initialization.
