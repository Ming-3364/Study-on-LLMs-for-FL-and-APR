Here is the corrected version of the method:\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ^\n    [javac] 100 errors\n    [javac] 1 warning\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/maven-build.xml:80: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\nTotal time: 2 seconds\nCannot compile sources! at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/d4j/d4j-compile line 82.\nCompilation failed in require at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/defects4j line 195.\n"

The issue with `this.currentChar = su_ch2Shadow;` is that `su_ch2Shadow` is being updated with the XOR operation before it's assigned to `this.currentChar`. This means `this.currentChar` will not have the correct value. To fix this, you should assign `su_ch2Shadow` to `this.currentChar` before performing the XOR operation.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:849: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here is the corrected method:\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:849: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here is the corrected method:\n    [javac]                      ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:849: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] Here is the corrected method:\n    [javac]                             ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:851: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:851: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:851: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:877: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:877: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:877: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:879: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] This change ensures that `this.currentChar` is correctly assigned the value of `su_ch2Shadow` before any modifications are made to it.\n    [javac]                    ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:879: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] This change ensures that `this.currentChar` is correctly assigned the value of `su_ch2Shadow` before any modifications are made to it.\n    [javac]                          ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:879: error: illegal start of type\n    [javac] This change ensures that `this.currentChar` is correctly assigned the value of `su_ch2Shadow` before any modifications are made to it.\n    [javac]                           ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/compress/compressors/bzip2/BZip2CompressorInputStream.java:879: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] This change ensures that `this.currentChar` is correctly assigned the value of `su_ch2Shadow` before any modifications are made to it.\n    [javac]                               ^\n    [javac] 100 errors\n    [javac] 1 warning\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_22-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/maven-build.xml:80: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\nTotal time: 2 seconds\nCannot compile sources! at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/d4j/d4j-compile line 82.\nCompilation failed in require at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/defects4j line 195.\n"
