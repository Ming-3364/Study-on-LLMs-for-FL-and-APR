In this case, the placement looks fine, but I'll re-format and ensure clarity:\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:116: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:116: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:116: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:116: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:117: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] @Override\n    [javac]          ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:276: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:276: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:276: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_23-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/univariate/BrentOptimizer.java:278: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] The key change here is to ensure the `return` statement inside the `if (stop)` condition properly breaks out of the loop when the stopping criterion is met.
