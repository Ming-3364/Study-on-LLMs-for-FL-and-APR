If the intention was to return a different field or calculation, you need to clarify what `getLocalFileDataLength()` was supposed to represent in the context of `getCentralDirectoryLength()`. Assuming you want to return a different length related to the central directory, you should replace `getLocalFileDataLength()` with the correct method or variable that retrieves the central directory length.
