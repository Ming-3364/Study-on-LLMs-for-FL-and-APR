The original code was using `container.getInvocationForStubbing().matches(stubbedInvocationMatcher.getInvocation())`, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be `stubbedInvocationMatcher.getInvocation().matches(invocation)`, as we need to check if the stubbed invocation matches the current invocation. This ensures that the correct stubbed response is returned when the invocation matches a stubbed method.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Mockito_25-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/org/mockito/internal/stubbing/defaultanswers/ReturnsDeepStubs.java:83: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] The bug in the code is likely related to the creation of the mock object and how it is being added to the `InvocationContainerImpl`.
