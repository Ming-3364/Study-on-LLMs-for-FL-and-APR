The issue you mentioned might be related to the fact that the method name suggests it should check if a function expression is \"reducible\" in some context, but the implementation only checks if it's a function expression. To address this, we need more context on what \"reducible\" means in your specific use case. However, I'll provide a more generic version that could incorporate additional checks. If you have specific criteria for \"reducible,\" you can replace the placeholder logic.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_55-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/FunctionRewriter.java:116: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Certainly!
