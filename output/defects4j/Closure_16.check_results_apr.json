The bug on line 12 seems to be related to how the `aliasedNode` is being accessed and used. Specifically, the `getQualifiedName()` method might not exist or might not be returning the correct value. Assuming that `aliasedNode` should be used directly, we can modify the code to use the `aliasedNode` correctly.
