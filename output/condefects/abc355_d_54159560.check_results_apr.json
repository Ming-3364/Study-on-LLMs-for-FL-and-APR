The corrected line `total += (ans - (i + 1) + 1);` ensures that the correct number of overlapping intervals is added to the total. This is because `ans` is the index of the last overlapping interval, and `(i + 1)` is the starting index of the search range. Adding 1 accounts for the inclusive count of intervals.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ^\nMain.java:46: error: ';' expected\n    public static int binary_search(Pair current, int s, int e, ArrayList<Pair> res) {\n          ^\n47 errors\n"
