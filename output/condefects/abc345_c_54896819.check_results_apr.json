The issue on line [5] seems to be related to the way the input string length is being calculated and used. The calculation of `sum` should not include the length of the string directly but rather be based on the number of possible pairs of characters. Here's the corrected version of the method:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ^\nMain.java:7: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n^\nMain.java:7: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:7: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:7: error: <identifier> expected\n```java\n       ^\nMain.java:8: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.HashMap;\n                        ^\nMain.java:9: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Map;\n^\nMain.java:9: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Map;\n      ^\nMain.java:9: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Map;\n           ^\nMain.java:9: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Map;\n                ^\nMain.java:9: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.Map;\n                    ^\nMain.java:10: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n^\nMain.java:10: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n      ^\nMain.java:10: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n           ^\nMain.java:10: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n                ^\nMain.java:10: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n                        ^\nMain.java:37: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n^\nMain.java:37: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n ^\nMain.java:37: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n  ^\nMain.java:39: error: illegal character: \\96\nThe line `[5]` was already correct in calculating the total number of unique pairs of characters.
