Based on the code you provided, it appears that the issue might be related to how the `rectY` is calculated. The current logic for `rectY` might not correctly handle the case where `transY2` is less than `transY1`. Let's correct that by ensuring `rectY` always represents the starting point of the rectangle.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:380: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here is the complete corrected method:\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:380: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here is the complete corrected method:\n    [javac]                     ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:380: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here is the complete corrected method:\n    [javac]                                      ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:382: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:382: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:382: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:382: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:511: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:511: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:511: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:513: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] The corrected line is:\n    [javac]                   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:513: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] The corrected line is:\n    [javac]                      ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:514: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:514: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Chart_25-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/source/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/StatisticalBarRenderer.java:514: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] 100 errors\n    [javac] 1 warning\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/projects/Chart/Chart.build.xml:57: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\nTotal time: 4 seconds\nCannot compile sources! at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/d4j/d4j-compile line 82.\nCompilation failed in require at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/defects4j line 195.\n"
