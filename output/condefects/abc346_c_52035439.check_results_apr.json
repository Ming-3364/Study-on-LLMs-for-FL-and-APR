The formula `(k * (k + 1)) / 2` calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `k`, but this might not be the intended behavior based on the context of the problem. If the goal is to calculate the sum of all integers less than `k`, then the formula is correct. However, if there's a specific condition or different logic required, we need to adjust accordingly.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ^\nMain.java:6: error: ';' expected\nCertainly!
