However, this can be problematic due to the way modulo operations work with negative numbers. Instead, the bitwise AND operation `(c & 1L) == 1L` is used to correctly check if the least significant bit is set. Additionally, the division and multiplication operations for `c` and `z` were replaced with bitwise shift operations (`c >>= 1L` and `z <<= 1L`) for better performance and clarity.}\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^\n62 errors\n"
