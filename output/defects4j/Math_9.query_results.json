Assuming `direction` is a `Vector`, and `zero` is a `Point`, you would need to subtract the direction vector from the point `zero`. However, typically a direction vector does not start from a specific point but is an offset itself. If `direction` is indeed a vector, then the correct way to create the reverted line would be to negate the direction vector.\n\nHere's the corrected method:\n\n```java\npublic Line revert() {\n    final Vector negatedDirection = direction.negate();\n    final Line reverted = new Line(zero, negatedDirection);\n    return reverted;\n}\n```\n\nThis assumes that `direction` is a `Vector` and has a `negate` method that returns its opposite vector. The `Line` constructor takes a `Point` (the starting point) and a `Vector` (the direction)."
