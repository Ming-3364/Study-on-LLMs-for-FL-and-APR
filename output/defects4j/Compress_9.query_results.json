The issue in line 65 seems to be that the `count(numToWrite);` method call at the end of the method is incorrect because it should reflect the number of bytes that were actually processed in the last loop iteration, not the remaining bytes after the loop. However, since `numToWrite` will be 0 at that point if the loop fully processed all bytes, and `count(0);` might not be meaningful, it's more appropriate to remove or adjust this call based on the context of `count()` method's purpose. Assuming `count()` is meant to log or process the number of bytes written in each invocation of `write()`, it should be called inside the loop where bytes are actually written.
