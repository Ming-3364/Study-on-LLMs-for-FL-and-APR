The issue with the loop condition `i < n - 2` is that it might cause an array out-of-bounds exception when accessing `a[i + 2]`. To fix this, you should ensure that `i + 2` does not exceed the length of the array. Since the array has `n * 2` elements, you need to adjust the loop condition accordingly.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ^\nMain.java:8: error: ';' expected\nHere is the corrected complete method:\n       ^\nMain.java:8: error: ';' expected\nHere is the corrected complete method:\n                     ^\nMain.java:8: error: ';' expected\nHere is the corrected complete method:\n                                     ^\nMain.java:10: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n^\nMain.java:10: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:10: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:10: error: <identifier> expected\n```java\n       ^\nMain.java:11: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n                        ^\nMain.java:12: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n^\nMain.java:12: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n      ^\nMain.java:12: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n           ^\nMain.java:12: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n                ^\nMain.java:12: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n                       ^\nMain.java:19: error: illegal start of expression\n        int a[] = Arrays.stream(new int[n * 2]).map(e -> sc.nextInt()).toArray();\n                                                       ^\nMain.java:31: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n^\nMain.java:31: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n ^\nMain.java:31: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n  ^\nMain.java:33: error: illegal start of type\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n   ^\nMain.java:33: error: ';' expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n       ^\nMain.java:33: error: <identifier> expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                         ^\nMain.java:33: error: ';' expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                              ^\nMain.java:33: error: ';' expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                        ^\nMain.java:33: error: illegal character: \\96\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                               ^\nMain.java:33: error: > expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                      ^\nMain.java:33: error: ';' expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                       ^\nMain.java:33: error: illegal start of type\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                          ^\nMain.java:33: error: <identifier> expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                           ^\nMain.java:33: error: illegal character: \\96\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                             ^\nMain.java:33: error: ';' expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                                       ^\nMain.java:33: error: ';' expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                                                     ^\nMain.java:33: error: <identifier> expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                                                        ^\nMain.java:33: error: ';' expected\nIn this corrected version, the loop runs until `i < n * 2 - 2` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.}\n                                                                                                       ^\n70 errors\n"
