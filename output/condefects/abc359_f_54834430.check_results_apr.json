The issue with `long d0 = d[o.i];` is that `d` is an array of integers (`int[]`), but you're treating it as if it were an array of longs (`long[]`). To fix this, you should change the type of the `d` array to `long[]`. Here is the complete corrected method:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ^\nMain.java:8: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n^\nMain.java:8: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:8: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:20: error: ')' expected\n    PriorityQueue<Obj> que = new PriorityQueue<>((o1, o2) -> Long.compare(o1.v, o2.v));\n                                                    ^\nMain.java:20: error: illegal start of expression\n    PriorityQueue<Obj> que = new PriorityQueue<>((o1, o2) -> Long.compare(o1.v, o2.v));\n                                                           ^\nMain.java:20: error: ';' expected\n    PriorityQueue<Obj> que = new PriorityQueue<>((o1, o2) -> Long.compare(o1.v, o2.v));\n                                                                                     ^\nMain.java:57: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n^\nMain.java:57: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n ^\nMain.java:57: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n  ^\nMain.java:59: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that all operations involving `d` are consistent with the correct data type.\n                 ^\nMain.java:59: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that all operations involving `d` are consistent with the correct data type.\n                                ^\nMain.java:59: error: illegal character: \\96\nThis ensures that all operations involving `d` are consistent with the correct data type.\n                                           ^\nMain.java:59: error: illegal character: \\96\nThis ensures that all operations involving `d` are consistent with the correct data type.\n                                             ^\nMain.java:59: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that all operations involving `d` are consistent with the correct data type.\n                                                             ^\nMain.java:59: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that all operations involving `d` are consistent with the correct data type.\n                                                                      ^\nMain.java:59: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that all operations involving `d` are consistent with the correct data type.\n                                                                                   ^\nMain.java:59: error: <identifier> expected\nThis ensures that all operations involving `d` are consistent with the correct data type.\n                                                                                         ^\nMain.java:60: error: ';' expected\n\tstatic class Obj {\n\t      ^\nMain.java:60: error: <identifier> expected\n\tstatic class Obj {\n\t                ^\nMain.java:64: error: class, interface, or enum expected\n}\n^\n62 errors\n"
