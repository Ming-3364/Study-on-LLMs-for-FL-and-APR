Without seeing the context of the `Gaussian` class, it's hard to know exactly what needs to be changed.\n\nTo fix this, here are a few potential things to check:\n\n1. **Ensure correct import of `Gaussian.Parametric`**:\n   If `Gaussian.Parametric` is part of an external library, make sure you have the correct import statement at the top of your file. For instance:\n   ```java\n   import org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.Gaussian;\n   ```\n\n2. **Correct constructor and object creation**:\n   Ensure that `Gaussian.Parametric()` is a valid way to create an object. If `Gaussian.Parametric` is a subclass, you may need to instantiate it differently or check for any other constructor requirements.\n\nIf everything seems correct and it's just an issue with class accessibility, here's how the code could look with basic corrections (assuming the class `Gaussian` and its `Parametric` subclass are valid and accessible):\n\npublic double[] fit() {\n    final double[] guess = (new ParameterGuesser(getObservations())).guess();\n    return fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);\n} \n\nIf you still encounter the error, could you provide additional context or errors related to `Gaussian` or the `fit` method?

Specifically, the problem might be that the `fit` method is not properly matching the signature of the parameters passed to it. It\u2019s possible that the `fit` method expects different arguments or the `Gaussian.Parametric` constructor does not work in this context. Let's assume the issue is that `Gaussian.Parametric()` should be a constructor or there\u2019s a mismatch in types.\n\nTo correct this, you should ensure that you are using the correct constructor and providing the right parameters.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected version of the method:\n\npublic double[] fit() {\n    final double[] guess = (new ParameterGuesser(getObservations())).guess();\n    return fit(new Gaussian.Parametric(), guess);  // Make sure `fit` accepts these parameters.\n}\n\n",

Ensure the `fit` method you are calling is accessible and correctly overloaded.\n2. Verify that `Gaussian.Parametric` is correctly instantiated and compatible with the `fit` method's expected parameter type.\n3.

If `fit` is a method in the same class, it should be defined to accept a `Gaussian.Parametric` object and a `double[]` array.

For example:\n\npublic class YourClass {\n\n    public double[] fit() {\n        final double[] guess = (new ParameterGuesser(getObservations())).guess();\n        Gaussian.Parametric gaussian = new Gaussian.Parametric();\n        return SomeOtherClass.fit(gaussian, guess); // Assuming fit is static in SomeOtherClass\n        // or\n        // SomeOtherClass fittingObject = new SomeOtherClass();\n        // return fittingObject.fit(gaussian, guess); // Assuming fit is an instance method\n    }\n\n    private YourObservationType[] getObservations() {\n        // Implementation to get observations\n        return new YourObservationType[0]; // Placeholder\n    }\n}\n\nReplace `SomeOtherClass` with the actual class containing the `fit` method, and ensure you have the correct imports and instantiations.
