We can achieve this by checking both conditions (`currentBlock != null` and `currentBlock != this`) in the loop condition.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_98-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ReferenceCollectingCallback.java:580: error: unclosed character literal\n    [javac] Here's the corrected method:\n    [javac]     ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_98-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ReferenceCollectingCallback.java:580: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here's the corrected method:\n    [javac]                     ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_98-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ReferenceCollectingCallback.java:580: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] Here's the corrected method:\n    [javac]                            ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_98-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ReferenceCollectingCallback.java:582: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_98-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ReferenceCollectingCallback.java:582: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_98-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ReferenceCollectingCallback.java:582: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_98-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ReferenceCollectingCallback.java:595: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] 100 errors\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_98-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/build.xml:56: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\nTotal time: 4 seconds\nCannot compile sources! at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/d4j/d4j-compile line 82.\nCompilation failed in require at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/defects4j line 195.\n"
