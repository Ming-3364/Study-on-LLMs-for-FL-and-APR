The issue with your code is that you are trying to access an element in the array `s` using an index that might be out of bounds. The value of `T % 3` could be 0, 1, or 2, which are valid indices for an array of size `N`, but if `N` is less than 3, then accessing `s[T % 3]` might lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^\nMain.java:7: error: ';' expected\nTo fix this, you should ensure that `T % 3` is within the bounds of the array `s`.
