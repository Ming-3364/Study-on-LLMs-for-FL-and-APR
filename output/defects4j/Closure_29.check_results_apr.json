Specifically, the code does not correctly handle cases where the object literal contains self-referential assignments, which can lead to incorrect inlining. The issue is in the loop that checks for self-referential assignments. The loop should be modified to correctly identify and handle these cases.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:157: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here is the complete corrected method:\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:157: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here is the complete corrected method:\n    [javac]                     ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:157: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here is the complete corrected method:\n    [javac]                                      ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:159: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:159: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:159: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:159: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:241: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:241: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:241: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:243: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Key Changes:\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:243: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Key Changes:\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:243: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Key Changes:\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:243: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] ### Key Changes:\n    [javac]                ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/InlineObjectLiterals.java:244: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] 1. **Self-referential Assignment Check**: The loop that checks for self-referential assignments was modified to directly compare `refNode` with `childVal` instead of traversing up the parent chain.

The original code was checking the parent of the reference node (`t.getParent()`) instead of the reference node itself (`t.getNode()`). This could lead to incorrect detection of self-referential assignments. The corrected code now checks the reference node directly, which is the correct way to identify self-referential assignments.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ^\n    [javac] 44 errors\n    [javac] 1 warning\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_29-prompt_apr_2-deepseek-chat/build.xml:258: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\nTotal time: 9 seconds\nCannot compile sources! at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/d4j/d4j-compile line 82.\nCompilation failed in require at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/defects4j line 195.\n"
