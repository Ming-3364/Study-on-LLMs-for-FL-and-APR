The issue stems from the value being passed to `g()`. However, there isn\u2019t enough information about what the method `g(j, n + 1)` is supposed to do or its implementation, which could mean either:\n\n1. There is a missing definition for the `g()` method.\n2. The parameters being passed might be incorrect for the context of the problem you're solving.\n\nMake sure that the method `g(j, n + 1)` is correctly defined elsewhere in your code and that it takes valid arguments. If `g(j, n + 1)` requires `n + 1`, then the code itself seems correct with respect to calling `g(j, n + 1)`.\n\nIn case `g(j, n + 1)` is not implemented yet, you'll need to define it properly. Here\u2019s a simple example where `g(j, n)` might calculate something like combinations or powers based on the context of the problem, though you'd need to adjust this depending on the problem's requirements:\n\n```java\n// Example of possible g function\nstatic long g(long j, long n) {\n    // Implement the logic for g(j, n) here\n    // This could involve combinatorics, powers, or other calculations\n    return 1; // placeholder return value\n}\n```",
            "deepseek-chat": "The bug in the code is likely related to the method `g(j, n + 1)` which is not defined in the provided code. Assuming that `g(j, n + 1)` is supposed to calculate the number of integers less than or equal to `n` that have the `j`-th bit set, we can replace it with the correct logic. Here is the corrected method:\n\n```java\nstatic void solve() throws IOException {\n    long n = rl(), m = rl();\n    long ans = 0, mod = 998244353L;\n    for (long j = 0; j <= 60; j++) {\n        if ((m & (1L << j)) != 0) {\n            // Calculate the number of integers less than or equal to n with the j-th bit set\n            long count = (n + 1) / (1L << (j + 1)) * (1L << j);\n            long remainder = (n + 1) % (1L << (j + 1));\n            if (remainder > (1L << j)) {\n                count += remainder - (1L << j);\n            }\n            ans += count;\n            ans %= mod;\n        }\n    }\n    System.out.println(ans);\n}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, the `g(j, n + 1)` function is replaced with the logic to calculate the number of integers less than or equal to `n` that have the `j`-th bit set. This is done by dividing the range into full cycles of `2^(j+1)` and then handling the remainder separately. The result is then added to `ans` and taken modulo `mod`.",

Additionally, I've added parentheses around the expression `(ans + g(j, n + 1)) % mod` to ensure that the addition and modulus operations are performed in the correct order and without overflow issues, although in this specific case, Java's operator precedence rules would have handled it correctly without the parentheses as well."

Since the code snippet does not provide the implementation of `g`, I will assume that `g(j, x)` computes some value based on `j` and `x` in a way that might be related to combinatorial mathematics or some other form of number theory, given the context.\n\nThe issue with `ans += g(j , n + 1);` might be related to the potential overflow or incorrect logic based on how `g` is defined.
