If your matrix has `N` rows and columns, and indexing starts from 0, the sum of indices for the right diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) should be `N-1` at the maximum for the last element in the diagonal. Hence, I changed it to `if (I + J == N - 1)`. If your indices start from 1, then the original condition might be correct.
