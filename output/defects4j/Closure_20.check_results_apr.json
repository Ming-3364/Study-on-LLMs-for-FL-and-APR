However, in this specific context, it seems that the check for `value` being non-null is sufficient since `value` should directly follow `callTarget` if the call is valid. The real issue might have been a misunderstanding of the need to check deeper, but since `value` is derived from `callTarget.getNext()`, a null check on `value` is sufficient.
