Please return the results in a strict JSON format as described below. Please follow these instructions carefully:
1. Your output must include each repaired line's number (`line_number`) and the corresponding fixed code statement (`fixed_statement`).
2. The output format must be a valid JSON array, where each element represents one repaired line, with the following structure:
   - `"line_number"`: The line number of the buggy code that was repaired (integer).
   - `"fixed_statement"`: The repaired statement for that specific line (string).

3. The result must strictly follow this format:
[
    {
        "line_number": int,
        "fixed_statement": "string"
    },
    {
        "line_number": int,
        "fixed_statement": "string"
    }
]
4. The repaired statement in "fixed_statement" must replace the corresponding line in the buggy code.
5. You must NOT include any additional explanation or description in your response. Only return the JSON array. Do not include ```json or ``` markers in the response.
