The issue with the current loop is that it starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-2`. This means it skips the first input value. To include all values except the last one, you should start the loop from `i = 0` and go up to `n-1`.

The loop should iterate `n` times to read `n` integers, but the current condition `i < n - 1` causes it to iterate only `n - 2` times. To fix this, the loop should start from `i = 0` and iterate until `i < n`. Here is the corrected method:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ^\n40 errors\n"
