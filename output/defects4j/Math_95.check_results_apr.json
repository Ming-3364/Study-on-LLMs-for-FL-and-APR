The issue with the line `double ret;` is that it declares a variable `ret` but does not initialize it. Although in this specific context, the variable `ret` is always assigned a value before being returned, it's good practice to initialize it to avoid potential issues if the code were to change. However, in this particular case, since the assignment is unconditional, initializing `ret` is not strictly necessary, but for clarity and good practice, we can set it to a default value (though it will be overwritten).\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_95-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/java/org/apache/commons/math/distribution/FDistributionImpl.java:143: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Sure, here is the complete corrected method.

However, in this particular case, since the assignment is unconditional, initializing `ret` is not strictly necessary, but for clarity and good practice, we can set it to a default value (though it will be overwritten).\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_95-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/java/org/apache/commons/math/distribution/FDistributionImpl.java:143: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Sure, here is the complete corrected method.
