The issue on line 4 is that `super.read()` might return -1 when there are no more bytes to read, and you should handle this case properly to avoid incrementing `lineCounter` incorrectly. Here's the corrected method:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic int read() throws IOException {\n    int current = super.read();\n    if (current != -1 && current == '\\n') {\n        lineCounter++;\n    }\n    lastChar = current;\n    return lastChar;\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures that `lineCounter` is only incremented when a newline character is actually read and not at the end of the stream.",
