The bug on line 10 is that the condition checks if `longOpt` starts with `opt`, which might add too many options if there are partial matches. To fix this, we should ensure that we only add a match if `opt` exactly matches `longOpt`. If you want to allow partial matches but also want a perfect match to be returned as a single option, you can modify the logic accordingly.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Cli_35-prompt_apr_1-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/cli/Options.java:233: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Certainly!
