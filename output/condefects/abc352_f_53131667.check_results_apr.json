The issue with the line `gs.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a.cnt));` is that the class `G` should have a field named `cnt` which represents the count. If this field does not exist or is named differently, it will cause a compilation error. Assuming `G` has a field `cnt`, the sorting logic seems fine. However, if there is a specific issue or if `G` does not have a `cnt` field, we need to ensure the correct field is used.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ^\nMain.java:23: error: ';' expected\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n       ^\nMain.java:23: error: ';' expected\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n                    ^\nMain.java:23: error: ';' expected\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n                                     ^\nMain.java:23: error: illegal character: \\96\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n                                               ^\nMain.java:23: error: illegal character: \\96\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n                                                 ^\nMain.java:23: error: ';' expected\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n                                                        ^\nMain.java:23: error: illegal character: \\96\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n                                                               ^\nMain.java:23: error: illegal character: \\96\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n                                                                   ^\nMain.java:23: error: illegal start of type\nHere is the complete corrected method assuming `G` has a field `cnt`:\n                                                                    ^\nMain.java:25: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n^\nMain.java:25: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:25: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:31: error: illegal start of expression\n    Arrays.setAll(list, i -> new ArrayList<>());\n                           ^\nMain.java:78: error: illegal start of expression\n    gs.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a.cnt));
