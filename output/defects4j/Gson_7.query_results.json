Specifically, the `peekedString` might still be in an intermediate state or might not be properly initialized. To fix this, we should ensure that `peekedString` is properly set before attempting to convert it to a `double`.\n\nHere's the complete corrected method:\n\n```java\npublic long nextLong() throws IOException {\n    int p = peeked;\n    if (p == PEEKED_NONE) {\n        p = doPeek();\n    }\n\n    if (p == PEEKED_LONG) {\n        peeked = PEEKED_NONE;\n        pathIndices[stackSize - 1]++;\n        return peekedLong;\n    }\n\n    if (p == PEEKED_NUMBER) {\n        peekedString = new String(buffer, pos, peekedNumberLength);\n        pos += peekedNumberLength;\n    } else if (p == PEEKED_SINGLE_QUOTED || p == PEEKED_DOUBLE_QUOTED) {\n        peekedString = nextQuotedValue(p == PEEKED_SINGLE_QUOTED ?

The original code correctly handles `PEEKED_NUMBER` by converting it to a string and then trying to parse it as an integer. However, if the number was too big for an `int` but not for a `long`, it would fall into the `NumberFormatException` catch block unnecessarily (since `PEEKED_LONG` is handled separately). I added a comment to clarify this, but the actual fix was to ensure the code structure was clear and that fallback mechanisms were in place. The provided corrected method should behave as intended."
