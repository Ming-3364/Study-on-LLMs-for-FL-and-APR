The issue on line [10] seems to be related to the logic where you are adding \"\u00d7\" when `i` is divisible by 3. However, based on your description, it seems you want to add \"\u00d7\" only when `i` is divisible by 3 without a remainder. Your current logic is correct for this requirement, but if you intended something different, please clarify. Here is the complete corrected method:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ^\nMain.java:6: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n^\nMain.java:6: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:6: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:6: error: <identifier> expected\n```java\n       ^\nMain.java:7: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n                          ^\nMain.java:8: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.List;\n^\nMain.java:8: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.List;\n      ^\nMain.java:8: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.List;\n           ^\nMain.java:8: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.List;\n                ^\nMain.java:8: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.List;\n                     ^\nMain.java:9: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n^\nMain.java:9: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n      ^\nMain.java:9: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n           ^\nMain.java:9: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n                ^\nMain.java:9: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n                        ^\nMain.java:32: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n^\nMain.java:32: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n ^\nMain.java:32: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n  ^\nMain.java:34: error: ';' expected\nThis code correctly adds \"\u00d7\" when `i` is divisible by 3 and \"o\" otherwise.
