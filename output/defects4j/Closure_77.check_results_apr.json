The bug in line [11] appears to be a syntax issue involving the comparison of characters in the string. The method `s.charAt(i - 1)` and `s.charAt(i - 2)` might cause an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if `i` is less than 2. To fix this, we need to add a boundary check before accessing these characters.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_77-prompt_apr_1-gpt-4o-mini/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeGenerator.java:956: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Sure!
