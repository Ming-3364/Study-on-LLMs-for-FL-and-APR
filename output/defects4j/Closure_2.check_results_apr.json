The main issue was handling the case where `implicitProto` might not have any property names, which could lead to a `NullPointerException` if not checked properly. Additionally, I added a null check for `oType.getPropertyType(name)` to ensure it doesn't cause a `NullPointerException` if `oType` is incorrectly annotated or malformed.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1568: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1568: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1568: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1568: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1606: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1606: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1606: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1608: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Explanation of Changes:\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1608: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Explanation of Changes:\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1608: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Explanation of Changes:\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1608: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] ### Explanation of Changes:\n    [javac]                   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1608: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] ### Explanation of Changes:\n    [javac]                           ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_2-prompt_apr_2-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypeCheck.java:1609: error: illegal start of type\n    [javac] 1. **Null Check for `implicitProto`**: Before calling `getOwnPropertyNames()`, a null check is added to ensure `implicitProto` is not null.
