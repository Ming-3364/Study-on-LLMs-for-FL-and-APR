The issue on line [5] seems to be related to the loop condition. The loop should continue as long as \\(i^3\\) is less than \\(N\\). However, the current condition \\(i * i * i < N\\) might cause an off-by-one error because it doesn't account for the case where \\(i^3\\) is exactly equal to \\(N\\). To fix this, we can adjust the condition slightly and ensure that the loop runs correctly.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^\nMain.java:4: error: ';' expected\nCertainly!
