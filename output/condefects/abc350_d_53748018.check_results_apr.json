The issue on line [22] seems to be related to the logic of calculating the number of connected components and their sizes. The `dfs` function should correctly count the nodes in each connected component. Let's assume the `dfs` function is defined elsewhere and correctly returns the size of the connected component.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ^\nMain.java:86: error: ';' expected\nHere is the complete corrected method:\n       ^\nMain.java:86: error: ';' expected\nHere is the complete corrected method:\n                    ^\nMain.java:86: error: ';' expected\nHere is the complete corrected method:\n                                     ^\nMain.java:88: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n^\nMain.java:88: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:88: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:88: error: <identifier> expected\n```java\n       ^\nMain.java:89: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n                          ^\nMain.java:90: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n^\nMain.java:90: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n      ^\nMain.java:90: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n           ^\nMain.java:90: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n                ^\nMain.java:90: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n                        ^\nMain.java:91: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n^\nMain.java:91: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n      ^\nMain.java:91: error: illegal start of type\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n           ^\nMain.java:91: error: ';' expected\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n                ^\nMain.java:91: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n                       ^\nMain.java:135: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n^\nMain.java:135: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n ^\nMain.java:135: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n  ^\nMain.java:137: error: <identifier> expected\nChanges made:\n            ^\nMain.java:138: error: illegal start of type\n1.
