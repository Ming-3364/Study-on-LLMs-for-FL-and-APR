This ensures that the solver doesn't face problems due to identical values at the endpoints.\n\n2. **Root-Finding Interval (Line 39)**:\n   The root-finding method now ensures the correct interval is passed to the `BrentSolver`. This interval is either `[ta, tb]` or `[tb, ta]` depending on the direction of integration, ensuring proper bracketing.\n\n3. **Proper Sign Change Handling (Line 43)**:\n   The logic for detecting sign changes and determining if an event has occurred is refined. The event occurrence is detected when there is a sign change in the function `g`. If an event is found, the solver will try to find the root of the event within the step.\n\nThis should address the issues in your code and make the event detection and handling logic more robust.",

In such cases, `ta` is slightly shifted to ensure that `ga` and `gb` have opposite signs, which is necessary for the root-finding algorithm to work correctly.\n2. **Event Detection Logic**: Ensured that the event detection logic correctly handles cases where an event is found near the boundary of the interval.\n\nThis corrected version should now handle edge cases more robustly and ensure that events are detected accurately.",

This ensures that `ga` and `gb` have opposite signs, which is necessary for the Brent solver to work correctly.\n\n2. **Function Evaluation Exception Handling**: The `FunctionEvaluationException` is caught and rethrown as appropriate, ensuring that the method handles exceptions correctly.\n\nThis should resolve the issue you were encountering.",
