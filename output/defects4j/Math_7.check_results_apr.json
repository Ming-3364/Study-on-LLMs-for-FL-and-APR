The issue you're encountering seems to be related to redundant calls to `stepAccepted` and potential inefficiencies. Specifically, the `stepAccepted` and `reset` methods are being called multiple times on the same `EventState` objects within the loop. To address this, we can streamline the logic by ensuring that each `EventState` is only processed once per iteration.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_7-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/ode/AbstractIntegrator.java:296: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Certainly!
