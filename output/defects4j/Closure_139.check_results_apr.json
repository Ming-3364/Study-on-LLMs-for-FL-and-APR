The issue with the original code is that it assumes `parent.hasOneChild()` is always true when `parent.getType() == Token.VAR`, but this might not be the case if the variable declaration includes an initializer (e.g., `var x = 5;`). The check for `parent.hasOneChild()` should be conditional and related to the specific logic you want to execute within that block.
