The issue with `PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(System.out);` is that it will buffer the output, which means it won't be immediately visible until the buffer is flushed or the `PrintWriter` is closed. To ensure that the output is printed immediately as it is generated (which is often desirable for debugging and user interaction), you should set the `PrintWriter` to auto-flush. However, in this case, since you are writing to `System.out`, using `System.out.println` directly is simpler and avoids the need for explicit flushing or closing.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ^\nMain.java:18: error: ';' expected\nCertainly!
