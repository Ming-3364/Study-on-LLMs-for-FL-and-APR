The issue lies in the calculation of the p-value for the t-distribution. The cumulative probability function returns the area under the curve from negative infinity to the t-value. For a two-tailed test, you need to consider both tails, so you should calculate `1 - tDistribution.cumulativeProbability(t)` and then multiply by 2. However, the `cumulativeProbability` function already considers the lower tail, so you should directly use `2 * tDistribution.cumulativeProbability(-t)` for the correct two-tailed p-value.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Math_69-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math/stat/correlation/PearsonsCorrelation.java:160: error: illegal start of type\n    [javac] Certainly, here is the corrected version of your method.
