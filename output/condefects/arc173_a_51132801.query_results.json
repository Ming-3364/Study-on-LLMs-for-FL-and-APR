Instead, you can set `right` to a more reasonable upper limit or use a dynamic approach to set it.\n\nHere is the corrected version of your code with an improved initialization for `right`:\n\n```java\nstatic long solve(long K) {\n    long left = 0;\n    // Set right to a reasonably large number or calculate it dynamically based on the problem constraints\n    long right = (long)1e6 + 1; \n    while (right - left > 1) {\n        long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\n        if (smallerNeq(mid) < K) {\n            left = mid;\n        } else {\n            right = mid;\n        }\n    }\n    return left;\n}\n```\n\nIn this version, `right` is set to `(long)1e6 + 1`, which should still cover most practical cases while reducing unnecessary computations.

The value `1e12` (which is $10^{12}$) when cast to a `long` is 1,000,000,000,000, and adding 1 to this does not cause an overflow directly, but it's better to avoid pushing boundaries unnecessarily.\n\nA common approach is to set `right` to the maximum value of a `long` directly, which is `Long.MAX_VALUE`.
