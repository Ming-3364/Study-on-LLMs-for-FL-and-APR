Here\u2019s the corrected version of the method:\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1375: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1375: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1375: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1375: error: not a statement\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]    ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1375: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1376: error: illegal start of expression\n    [javac] void maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1376: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] void maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    [javac]                               ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1376: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] void maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    [javac]                                                          ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1376: error: not a statement\n    [javac] void maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    [javac]                                                           ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1376: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] void maybeDeclareQualifiedName(NodeTraversal t, JSDocInfo info,\n    [javac]                                                               ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1377: error: ';' expected\n    [javac]         Node n, Node parent, Node rhsValue) {\n    [javac]                     ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1377: error: not a statement\n    [javac]         Node n, Node parent, Node rhsValue) {\n    [javac]                      ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1377: error: ';' expected\n    [javac]         Node n, Node parent, Node rhsValue) {\n    [javac]                            ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1377: error: ';' expected\n    [javac]         Node n, Node parent, Node rhsValue) {\n    [javac]                                           ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1493: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1493: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1493: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_54-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/TypedScopeCreator.java:1495: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] The key change is to ensure that the `if (!qVar.isTypeInferred()) {` block does not prematurely return without performing the necessary checks.
