The issue with the initialization of `ans` is that it should be initialized to a value that makes sense in the context of your problem. Since you are dealing with `long` values and accumulating sums, initializing `ans` to `0` might not be appropriate if the path sums can be negative or zero. Typically, you would initialize `ans` to `Long.MIN_VALUE` to ensure that any valid path sum will be larger.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ^\nMain.java:28: error: ';' expected\nCertainly!
