The issue with your loop is that you are iterating from 1 to `n+17`, which seems incorrect based on your requirement. If you want to generate a sequence of 'x' and 'o' based on the condition `i % 3 == 0` up to a number `n`, you should iterate only up to `n`. Here is the corrected complete method:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ^\nMain.java:22: error: ';' expected\nCertainly!
