This could lead to a `NullPointerException` if `getRecord()` returned `null`. The fix adds a check for `headerBuf == null` in the condition to ensure that the method returns `null` if `headerBuf` is `null`. This prevents the `NullPointerException` and ensures proper handling of the end-of-file condition.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ^\n    [javac] 54 errors\n    [javac] 1 warning\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Compress_12-prompt_apr_1-deepseek-chat/maven-build.xml:80: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\nTotal time: 2 seconds\nCannot compile sources! at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/d4j/d4j-compile line 82.\nCompilation failed in require at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/defects4j line 195.\n"
