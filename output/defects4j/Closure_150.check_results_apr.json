The issue seems to be that `attachLiteralTypes(n);` is being called before the `switch` statement, which might cause unintended behavior for certain node types like `Token.FUNCTION`, `Token.CATCH`, and `Token.VAR`. To avoid this, we should move the `attachLiteralTypes(n);` call inside the appropriate cases within the `switch` statement.\n    [javac]
