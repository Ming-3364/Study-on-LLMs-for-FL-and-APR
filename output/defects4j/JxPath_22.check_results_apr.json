Specifically, the problem lies in the casting of the node type and handling of the `Node` type inside the loop. The main bug is in how the method `getPrefix` and the `getNamespaceURI` are being used together when the namespace is not found. Additionally, the loop seems to incorrectly traverse nodes without checking for the correct type at each level.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:674: error: illegal character: \\8217\n    [javac] Here\u2019s the corrected method:\n    [javac]     ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:674: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here\u2019s the corrected method:\n    [javac]           ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:674: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] Here\u2019s the corrected method:\n    [javac]                            ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:676: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:676: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:676: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:676: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:706: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:706: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:706: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:708: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Explanation of changes:\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:708: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Explanation of changes:\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:708: error: illegal character: \\35\n    [javac] ### Explanation of changes:\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:708: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] ### Explanation of changes:\n    [javac]                   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:708: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] ### Explanation of changes:\n    [javac]                           ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/JxPath_22-prompt_apr_2-gpt-4o-mini/src/java/org/apache/commons/jxpath/ri/model/dom/DOMNodePointer.java:709: error: illegal start of type\n    [javac] 1. **Element Type Check**: After the initial check for `Document`, I added an additional check to ensure the node is indeed an instance of `Element` before proceeding.
