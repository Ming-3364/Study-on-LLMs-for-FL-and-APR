The previous condition `n.getJSType() != null && parent.isAssign()` allowed cases where `n` might be indirectly involved in the assignment (e.g., through intermediary nodes like parentheses), which could lead to incorrect behavior. The new condition `!parent.getLastChild().equals(n)` ensures that `n` is indeed the node being assigned to, without any intermediary nodes.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ^\n    [javac] 37 errors\n    [javac] 1 warning\n\nBUILD FAILED\n/data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_11-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/build.xml:258: Compile failed; see the compiler error output for details.\n\nTotal time: 16 seconds\nCannot compile sources! at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/d4j/d4j-compile line 82.\nCompilation failed in require at /data/cmd/Ming/LLM_Based-Mutation/tools/mutant/defects4j-2.1.0/framework/bin/defects4j line 195.\n"
