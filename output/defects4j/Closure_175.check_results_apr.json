The issue seems to be related to the loop condition and the logic inside the loop. Specifically, the `while` loop condition `while (cArg != null || fnParam != null)` might lead to incorrect behavior because it continues as long as either `cArg` or `fnParam` is non-null. This could cause the loop to terminate prematurely or continue unnecessarily.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_175-prompt_apr_2-qwen-turbo/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/FunctionInjector.java:688: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] Certainly!
