The issue with the line `var add = A[i] * pow[j + 1] % MOD;` is that it calculates `pow[j + 1]` without checking if `j + 1` is within the bounds of the `pow` array. This can lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. To fix this, we need to ensure that `j + 1` does not exceed the length of the `pow` array.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ^\nMain.java:12: error: unclosed character literal\nHere's the complete corrected method:\n    ^\nMain.java:12: error: ';' expected\nHere's the complete corrected method:\n                   ^\nMain.java:12: error: ';' expected\nHere's the complete corrected method:\n                                    ^\nMain.java:14: error: illegal character: '`'\n```java\n^\nMain.java:14: error: illegal character: '`'\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:14: error: illegal character: '`'\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:14: error: <identifier> expected\n```java\n       ^\nMain.java:58: error: illegal character: '`'\n```\n^\nMain.java:58: error: illegal character: '`'\n```\n ^\nMain.java:58: error: illegal character: '`'\n```\n  ^\nMain.java:60: error: illegal character: '`'\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                  ^\nMain.java:60: error: ']' expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                       ^\nMain.java:60: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                        ^\nMain.java:60: error: illegal character: '`'\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                             ^\nMain.java:60: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                      ^\nMain.java:60: error: <identifier> expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                               ^\nMain.java:60: error: illegal character: '`'\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                   ^\nMain.java:60: error: <identifier> expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                     ^\nMain.java:60: error: illegal character: '`'\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                         ^\nMain.java:60: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                                    ^\nMain.java:60: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                                              ^\nMain.java:60: error: ';' expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                                                       ^\nMain.java:60: error: illegal character: '`'\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                                                            ^\nMain.java:60: error: illegal character: '`'\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                                                                ^\nMain.java:60: error: <identifier> expected\nThis ensures that `pow[j + 1]` is only accessed if `j + 1` is within the valid range of the `pow` array.}\n                                                                                                        ^\n59 errors\n"
