The issue in line 6 was related to the `getLastChar()` method which was not defined and likely intended to get the last character of some input string. I've assumed a scenario where you might be building a string representation of numbers and `getLastChar()` should fetch the last character of this string. However, since we don't have the full context of `getLastChar()`, I've added a comment indicating where you might want to define or modify this method.\n    [javac]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:242: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:242: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:242: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```java\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:271: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac] ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:271: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:271: error: illegal character: \\96\n    [javac] ```\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:273: error: illegal start of type\n    [javac] **Note**:\n    [javac]  ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:273: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] **Note**:\n    [javac]   ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:273: error: illegal start of type\n    [javac] **Note**:\n    [javac]       ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:273: error: <identifier> expected\n    [javac] **Note**:\n    [javac]        ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:273: error: ';' expected\n    [javac] **Note**:\n    [javac]         ^\n    [javac] /data/cmd/Ming/llm-fl-apr/tmp/Closure_38-prompt_apr_1-ernie-3.5-128k/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/CodeConsumer.java:274: error: illegal start of type\n    [javac] 1.
