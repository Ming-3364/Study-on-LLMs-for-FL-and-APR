Here's the corrected version of your code:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ^\nMain.java:12: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n^\nMain.java:12: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:12: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:12: error: <identifier> expected\n```java\n       ^\nMain.java:13: error: <identifier> expected\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n                        ^\nMain.java:29: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n^\nMain.java:29: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n ^\nMain.java:29: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n  ^\nMain.java:31: error: ';' expected\nThis should work correctly as long as the input string has at least 6 characters.}\n                ^\nMain.java:31: error: ';' expected\nThis should work correctly as long as the input string has at least 6 characters.}\n                             ^\nMain.java:31: error: ';' expected\nThis should work correctly as long as the input string has at least 6 characters.}\n                                     ^\nMain.java:31: error: ';' expected\nThis should work correctly as long as the input string has at least 6 characters.}\n                                               ^\nMain.java:31: error: ';' expected\nThis should work correctly as long as the input string has at least 6 characters.}\n                                                          ^\nMain.java:31: error: ';' expected\nThis should work correctly as long as the input string has at least 6 characters.}\n                                                                   ^\nMain.java:31: error: <identifier> expected\nThis should work correctly as long as the input string has at least 6 characters.}\n                                                                                 ^\nMain.java:31: error: reached end of file while parsing\nThis should work correctly as long as the input string has at least 6 characters.}\n                                                                                  ^\n56 errors\n"
