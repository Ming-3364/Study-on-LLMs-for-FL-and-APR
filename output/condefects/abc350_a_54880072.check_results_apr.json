The condition in your `if` statement seems to have an error because it checks for `s > 349` or `s == 316`, which might not be what you intended. If you want to check if `s` is greater than 349 but exclude 316, you should use an `&&` operator instead of `||`. Here is the corrected version of your method:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ^\nMain.java:6: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n^\nMain.java:6: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n ^\nMain.java:6: error: illegal character: \\96\n```java\n  ^\nMain.java:6: error: <identifier> expected\n```java\n       ^\nMain.java:13: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n^\nMain.java:13: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n ^\nMain.java:13: error: illegal character: \\96\n```\n  ^\nMain.java:15: error: <identifier> expected\nThis way, the program will print \"No\" only if `s` is greater than 349 and not equal to 316.
